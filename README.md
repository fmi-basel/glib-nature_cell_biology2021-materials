# Cell fate coordinates mechano-osmotic forces in intestinal crypt formation - Materials
  
This repository contains three subfolders with methods of the Paper "Cell fate coordinates mechano-osmotic forces in intestinal crypt formation":

* ```time-course/```: Image Processing Pipeline for 2D/3D organoid segmentation - time course samples (based on DAPI signal)

* ```time-lapse/```: Image Processing Pipeline for 2D/3D organoid segmentation - time lapse samples (based on LifeAct signal)

* ```Distance_between_Villi/```: Measurement of distance between villi

* ```Supplementary_code_for_label/```: Labeling of single-cell areas on in vivo sections


Further information are given in the README.md files of the corresponding subfolders. Note that you may require different virtual environments for the different parts due to conflicting dependencies.
